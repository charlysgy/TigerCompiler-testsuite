# Testsuite for the TigerCompiler project done at EPITA

This bash file was written with intent to launch a program and test it's output and return code.
This is very basic as a testsuite but uses many fundamental bash mechanism:
  -  Multiple redirection to seperate stdout and stderr, it eases the debug step
  -  Conditional structure on strings, bools and ints
  -  Loops as for, while
  -  File reading
  -  The use of "cut" and others bash functionnalities
  -  Piping
  -  Parsing of arguments
  -  Function declaration and use
  -  Formatted output with printf
  -  Use of vars
